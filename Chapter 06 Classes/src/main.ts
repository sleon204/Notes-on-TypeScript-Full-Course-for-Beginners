   Terminology
------------------------

TypeScript: A strongly typed programming language compiling to JavaScript, providing better tooling at any scale.

Compiler: Translates TypeScript code (with type annotations) into standard JavaScript for execution.

Static Typing: Specifies types of variables, parameters, and return values at compile-time to catch errors early.

Variable: Named storage holding a value. In TypeScript, allows declaration with specific types for clarity.

Parameter: Variable in function/method declaration representing an input value. Defines required information for function execution.

Expression: Piece of code producing a single value, composed of literals, variables, operators, and function calls.

Functions: Blocks of reusable code performing specific tasks, taking input parameters and optionally returning a value.

Basic Types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, object, any, union.

Inference: Compiler automatically deduces types of variables and expressions based on context, without explicit type annotations.

Implicit: TypeScript makes decisions/actions without explicit instructions, introducing risks if not used carefully for type safety.

Explicit: Clear, specific actions or declarations leaving no room for assumptions or interpretation.

Type Coercion: Automatic conversion of one data type to another in programming languages.

Concatenation: Process of combining two or more strings into a single string.

RegExp: Powerful tool for pattern matching and text manipulation using search patterns.

Element: Individual item within an array or collection.

Tuple: Ordered collection of elements, each with a specific type, more strict than arrays.

Type Alias: Creating a new name for a type, allowing descriptive or concise naming or complex type creation.

Interface: Contract for an object's shape, specifying names, types, and methods an object must have.

Optional Properties: Properties marked with '?' in interfaces/types, indicating non-mandatory attributes.

Enum: Collection of named constants for related values, facilitating structured usage within a context.

Literal Types: Represent exact values rather than a range, allowing specification of specific values.

Void Type: Denotes absence of any specific type, used for functions returning nothing or undefined.

Signature: Declaration of a function/method including its name, parameters, return type, and visibility/access level.

Rest Parameter: Feature in JavaScript allowing functions to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

Never Type: Type representing values that never occur, used in scenarios where something should never happen or a function never returns.

Type Assertions: Mechanism to tell TypeScript about the intended type of a value, providing flexibility when TypeScript cannot infer it automatically.

Unknown Type: Represents a type-safe 'any'. Unlike any, you can't operate on its values without narrowing the type. Useful for stricter type checking in uncertain scenarios.
